## Install dependencies
Execute:
```
yarn install
```

## Run server
* Execute:
1. This command will get the server up and run a bash script to minify the client .js files, thus getting a better load time.
```
yarn serve
```
2. Will do the same as the previous command with the change that a python3 script will be used to minify, note the bash script is preferred.
```
yarn servep
```
3. This command is for the developers only, not changing anything about any file, just getting the server up.
```
yarn up
```


* Open http://localhost:2000 in a modern browser
* Enjoy!
